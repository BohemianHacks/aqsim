**Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**

- In the Standard Model, QFT describes how elementary particles like quarks, electrons, and force-carrying bosons interact
- It provides a quantum mechanical description of phenomena like particle creation and annihilation
- QFT has been experimentally verified to extraordinary precision, such as predicting the magnetic moment of the electron with accuracy to within 1 part in a trillion

**Quantum Gravity**

- String Theory: Proposes that fundamental particles are actually tiny vibrating strings
- Loop Quantum Gravity: Suggests space-time itself has a quantum, granular structure
- Potential implications include understanding:
  - The physics inside black holes
  - The moment of the Big Bang
  - Whether time and space are fundamental or emergent properties

**Quantum Biology**

- Photosynthesis: Quantum coherence may explain the extraordinary efficiency of energy transfer in plants
- Bird Navigation: Quantum entanglement in cryptochrome proteins might explain how birds sense Earth's magnetic field
- Enzyme Catalysis: Quantum tunneling could help explain how enzymes accelerate chemical reactions
- Potential implications for understanding consciousness, genetic mutations, and metabolic processes
